I ran my code in linux terminal. 
I had to install gcc. 
I also installed gedit as my code editor.
Then I cd'd to the folder that it was located in. 
Then I typed: gcc -o (Program_name) (Program_name.c). (no paranthesis just example names)
After it compiled I ran the program by typing: ./Program_name

Both of the files properly compiled and ran successfully.
